# Classes and Objects in Python: Calculate the Area of a Circle

##  Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **area of a circle** based on the radius provided by the user. This program uses a class named `cse` and a method `mech` to perform the calculation.

##  Algorithm
1. **Get user input**: Take the radius of the circle as input from the user.
2. **Define the class**: Create a class named `cse`.
3. **Define the method**: Inside the class, define the method `mech` to calculate the area of the circle using the formula:  
   Area = pi *r^2 
4. **Execute the program**: Create an object of the class and call the method with the radius value.

##  Program

```python


import math
class cse:
    def stationary(self):
        r=int(input())
        return 3.141592*r*r
obj=cse()
print("Area of circle:",round(obj.stationary(),2))

```

## Result
Thus,the program is executed successfully.
